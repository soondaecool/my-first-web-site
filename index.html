<h2> WEB </h2>
<p> Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a web server or from
local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</p>
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
 the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
 by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
 lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
  written using angle brackets.
